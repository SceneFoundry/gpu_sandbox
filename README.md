vk_sandbox

vk_sandbox is an experimental graphics programming playground built with modern C++ and Vulkan.
The primary goal of this project is to serve as a hands-on learning environment for exploring advanced rendering techniques, engine architecture, and real-time graphics development.

This repository is not intended to be a production ready engine. Its purpose is to experiment, iterate, and gain a deeper understanding of Vulkanâ€™s low level rendering pipeline,
modern rendering practices, and C++17/20 design patterns.
